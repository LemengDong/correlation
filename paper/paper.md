# Introduction

Correlations tests are arguably one of the most commonly used statistical procedures, and are used as a basis in many applications such as exploratory data analysis, structural modelling, data engineering etc. In this context, we present **correlation**, a toolbox for the R language [@Rteam] and part of the [**easystats**](https://github.com/easystats/easystats) collection, focused on correlation analysis. Its goal is to be lightweight, easy to use, and allows for the computation of many different kinds of correlations, such as:

- **Pearson's correlation**: This is the most common correlation method. It corresponds to the covariance of the two variables normalized (i.e., divided) by the product of their standard deviations.

$$r_{x,y} = \frac{cov(x,y)}{SD_x \times SD_y}$$

- **Spearman's rank correlation**: A non-parametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). Confidence Intervals (CI) for Spearman's correlations are computed using the @fieller1957tests correction [see @bishara2017confidence].

$$\rho_{x,y} = \frac{cov(rank_x, rank_y)}{SD(rank_x) \times SD(rank_y)}$$

- **Kendall's rank correlation**: In the normal case, the Kendall correlation is preferred than the Spearman correlation because of a smaller gross error sensitivity (GES) and a smaller asymptotic variance (AV), making it more robust and more efficient. However, the interpretation of Kendall's tau is less direct than that of Spearman's rho, in the sense that it quantifies the difference between the % of concordant and discordant pairs among all possible pairwise events. Confidence Intervals (CI) for Kendall's correlations are computed using the @fieller1957tests correction [see @bishara2017confidence].

$$\tau_{x,y} =  \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\sum_{i<j}^{}sign(x_i - x_j) \times sign(y_i - y_j)$$

- **Biweight midcorrelation**: A measure of similarity that is median-based, instead of the traditional mean-based, thus being less sensitive to outliers. It can be used as a robust alternative to other similarity metrics, such as Pearson correlation [@langfelder2012fast].

- **Distance correlation**: Distance correlation measures both linear and non-linear association between two random variables or random vectors. This is in contrast to Pearson's correlation, which can only detect linear association between two random variables.

- **Percentage bend correlation**: Introduced by Wilcox (1994), it is based on a down-weight of a specified percentage of marginal observations deviating from the median (by default, 20%).

- **Shepherd's Pi correlation**: Equivalent to a Spearman's rank correlation after outliers removal (by means of bootstrapped Mahalanobis distance).

- **Point-Biserial and biserial correlation**: Correlation coefficient used when one variable is continuous and the other is dichotomous (binary). Point-Biserial is equivalent to a Pearson's correlation, while Biserial should be used when the binary variable is assumed to have an underlying continuity. For example, anxiety level can be measured on a continuous scale, but can be classified dichotomously as high/low.

- **Polychoric correlation**: Correlation between two theorised normally distributed continuous latent variables, from two observed ordinal variables.

- **Tetrachoric correlation**: Special case of the polychoric correlation applicable when both observed variables are dichotomous.

- **Partial correlation**: Correlation between two variables after adjusting for the (linear) the effect of one or more variable. The correlation test is here run after having partialized the dataset, independently from it. In other words, it considers partialization as an independent step generating a different dataset, rather than belonging to the same model. This is why some discrepancies are to be expected for the *t*- and the *p*-values (but not the correlation coefficient) compared to other implementations such as **ppcor**.

$$r_{xy.z} = r_{e_{x.z},e_{y.z}}$$

*Where $e_{x.z}$ are the residuals from the linear prediction of $x$ by $z$. This can be expanded to a multivariate $z$.*

- **Multilevel correlation**: Multilevel correlations are a special case of partial correlations where the variable to be adjusted for is a factor and is included as a random effect in a mixed model.

These methods allow for different ways of quantifying the link between two variables (see **Figure 1**).

# Design


It relies on one main function, `correlation()`, which outputs a dataframe containing each pairwise correlation per row. This long format is convenient for further data analysis, but not as much to get a summary, which is usually obtained via a correlation matrix. To address this, we added standard methods, such as `summary()` and `as.matrix()`, to automatically transform the long output to a matrix. Moreover, **correlation** also include plotting capabilities via the [**see** package](https://easystats.github.io/see/) [@ludecke2019see].

# Examples

## Correlation details and matrix

\footnotesize

``` r
cor <- correlation(iris)
cor
# Parameter1   |   Parameter2 |     r |         95% CI |     t |  df |      p |  Method | n_Obs
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |  Sepal.Width | -0.12 | [-0.27,  0.04] | -1.44 | 148 | 0.152  | Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Length | Petal.Length |  0.87 | [ 0.83,  0.91] | 21.65 | 148 | < .001 | Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Length |  Petal.Width |  0.82 | [ 0.76,  0.86] | 17.30 | 148 | < .001 | Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Width  | Petal.Length | -0.43 | [-0.55, -0.29] | -5.77 | 148 | < .001 | Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Width  |  Petal.Width | -0.37 | [-0.50, -0.22] | -4.79 | 148 | < .001 | Pearson |   150
# Petal.Length |  Petal.Width |  0.96 | [ 0.95,  0.97] | 43.39 | 148 | < .001 | Pearson |   150
```

\normalsize

The output is not a square matrix, but a **(tidy) dataframe with all correlations tests per row**. One can also obtain a **matrix** using:

\small

``` r
summary(cor)
# Parameter    | Petal.Width | Petal.Length | Sepal.Width
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |     0.82*** |      0.87*** |       -0.12
# Sepal.Width  |    -0.37*** |     -0.43*** |            
# Petal.Length |     0.96*** |              |
```

\normalsize

Note that one can also obtain the full, **square** and redundant matrix using:

\small

``` r
summary(cor, redundant=TRUE)
# Parameter    | Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | Petal.Length | Petal.Width
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |      1.00*** |       -0.12 |      0.87*** |     0.82***
# Sepal.Width  |        -0.12 |     1.00*** |     -0.43*** |    -0.37***
# Petal.Length |      0.87*** |    -0.43*** |      1.00*** |     0.96***
# Petal.Width  |      0.82*** |    -0.37*** |      0.96*** |     1.00***
```

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(see)

cor %>% 
  summary(redundant=TRUE) %>% 
  plot()
```

\normalsize

## Grouped dataframes

The function also supports **stratified correlations**, all within the *tidyverse* [@Wickham_2019] workflow\!

\scriptsize

``` r
iris %>% 
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Width) %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  correlation()
# Group      |   Parameter1 |  Parameter2 |    r |        95% CI |    t | df |      p |  Method | n_Obs
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# setosa     | Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | 0.74 | [ 0.59, 0.85] | 7.68 | 48 | < .001 | Pearson |    50
# setosa     | Sepal.Length | Petal.Width | 0.28 | [ 0.00, 0.52] | 2.01 | 48 | 0.101  | Pearson |    50
# setosa     |  Sepal.Width | Petal.Width | 0.23 | [-0.05, 0.48] | 1.66 | 48 | 0.104  | Pearson |    50
# versicolor | Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | 0.53 | [ 0.29, 0.70] | 4.28 | 48 | < .001 | Pearson |    50
# versicolor | Sepal.Length | Petal.Width | 0.55 | [ 0.32, 0.72] | 4.52 | 48 | < .001 | Pearson |    50
# versicolor |  Sepal.Width | Petal.Width | 0.66 | [ 0.47, 0.80] | 6.15 | 48 | < .001 | Pearson |    50
# virginica  | Sepal.Length | Sepal.Width | 0.46 | [ 0.20, 0.65] | 3.56 | 48 | 0.002  | Pearson |    50
# virginica  | Sepal.Length | Petal.Width | 0.28 | [ 0.00, 0.52] | 2.03 | 48 | 0.048  | Pearson |    50
# virginica  |  Sepal.Width | Petal.Width | 0.54 | [ 0.31, 0.71] | 4.42 | 48 | < .001 | Pearson |    50
```

## Bayesian Correlations

It is very easy to switch to a **Bayesian framework** (for which it relies on the **bayestestR** [@makowski2019bayestestr] and the **BayesFactor** [@BayesFactor] packages.

\scriptsize

``` r
correlation(iris, bayesian = TRUE)
# Parameter1   |   Parameter2 |   rho |         95% CI |     pd | % in ROPE |    BF |              Prior | n_Obs
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |  Sepal.Width | -0.12 | [-0.24,  0.01] | 91.83% |    43.08% |  0.51 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
# Sepal.Length | Petal.Length |  0.86 | [ 0.83,  0.90] |   100% |        0% | > 999 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
# Sepal.Length |  Petal.Width |  0.80 | [ 0.76,  0.85] |   100% |        0% | > 999 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
# Sepal.Width  | Petal.Length | -0.42 | [-0.52, -0.31] |   100% |        0% | > 999 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
# Sepal.Width  |  Petal.Width | -0.35 | [-0.47, -0.25] |   100% |     0.02% | > 999 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
# Petal.Length |  Petal.Width |  0.96 | [ 0.95,  0.97] |   100% |        0% | > 999 | Cauchy (0 +- 0.33) |   150
```

## Tetrachoric, Polychoric, Biserial, Biweightâ¦

The `correlation` package also supports different types of methods, which can deal with correlations **between factors**\!

\scriptsize

``` r
correlation(iris, include_factors = TRUE, method = "auto")
# Parameter1         |         Parameter2 |     r |         95% CI |      t |  df |      p |         Method | n_Obs
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length       |        Sepal.Width | -0.12 | [-0.27,  0.04] |  -1.44 | 148 | 0.452  |        Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Length       |       Petal.Length |  0.87 | [ 0.83,  0.91] |  21.65 | 148 | < .001 |        Pearson |   150
# Sepal.Length       |        Petal.Width |  0.82 | [ 0.76,  0.86] |  17.30 | 148 | < .001 |        Pearson |   150

# Species.versicolor |  Species.virginica | -0.88 | [-0.91, -0.84] | -22.35 | 148 | < .001 |    Tetrachoric |   150
```

\normalsize

## Partial Correlations

It also supports **partial correlations** (as well as Bayesian partial correlations).

\small

``` r
iris %>% 
  correlation(partial = TRUE) %>% 
  summary()
# Parameter    | Petal.Width | Petal.Length | Sepal.Width
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |    -0.34*** |      0.72*** |     0.63***
# Sepal.Width  |     0.35*** |     -0.62*** |            
# Petal.Length |     0.87*** |              |
```

\normalsize

## Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs)

Such partial correlations can also be represented as **Gaussian Graphical Models** (GGM), an increasingly popular tool in psychology. A GGM traditionally include a set of variables depicted as circles ("nodes"), and a set of lines that visualize relationships between them, which thickness represents the strength of association [@epskamp2018estimating; @Bhushan_2019].

\small

``` r
library(see) # for plotting
library(ggraph) # needs to be loaded

mtcars %>% 
  correlation(partial = TRUE) %>% 
  plot()
```

\normalsize

![Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM), - or network graph, that can be automatically obtained via the **see** package.](figure3.png)

## Multilevel Correlations

It also provide some cutting-edge methods, such as Multilevel (partial) correlations. These are are partial correlations based on **linear mixed models** that include the factors as random effects. In other words, in traditional partial correlations, the covariates are "adjusted for" by setting them as fixed factors in a linear regression model, whereas in multilevel correlations they are entered as random indercepts. Multilevel correlations can be see as correlations *adjusted* for some group (*hierarchical*) variability.

\small

``` r
iris %>% 
  correlation(partial = TRUE, multilevel = TRUE) %>% 
  summary()
# Parameter    | Petal.Width | Petal.Length | Sepal.Width
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |      -0.17* |      0.71*** |     0.43***
# Sepal.Width  |     0.39*** |       -0.18* |            
# Petal.Length |     0.38*** |              |
```

\normalsize

However, if the `partial` argument is set to `FALSE`, it will try to convert the partial coefficient into regular ones.These can be **converted back** to full correlations:

\small

``` r
iris %>% 
  correlation(partial = FALSE, multilevel = TRUE) %>% 
  summary()
# Parameter    | Petal.Width | Petal.Length | Sepal.Width
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Sepal.Length |     0.36*** |      0.76*** |     0.53***
# Sepal.Width  |     0.47*** |      0.38*** |            
# Petal.Length |     0.48*** |              |
```
